     <div class="slide-card active-slide">
        <h1 style="margin: 3em 1em 0em 1em; text-align: center;">What Factors Influence Movie Success?</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="slide-card inactive-slide">
        <h2>Factor One: Genres</h2>
        <svg width="1000" height="500" id="genres_graph"></svg>
        <p></p>
        <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: smaller;">
          The first factor we considered is genre. We chose to track the success of the top 10 revenue-generating genres of all time over time.
          We wanted to explore the claims of academic papers that claimed genre popularity fluctuates with economic climate:
          <a href="https://www.econbiz.de/Record/on-the-relationship-between-movie-genre-popularity-and-a-country-s-economic-condition-berger-paul/10008739311">Paper One,</a>
          <a href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cmc_theses/3836/#:~:text=The%20findings%20suggest%20that%20film,in%20response%20to%20economic%20cycles.">Paper Two.</a>
          
          <br><br>
          Upon exploration of the stream graph, which we chose due to its helpfulness in identifying big-picture trends, we found that there is little evidence to suggest that genre popularity is linked to economic climate.
          <br><br>

          We explored some notable recession years (1975, 1982, 1991, 2009, 2020) and failed to prove that poor economic state led to certain genres gaining or losing popularity.
          An interesting observation we found, though, was that during the great reccession (2007-2009), avg revenue for aventure and science fiction went up each year while thriller and comedy went down each year. 
          We feel that there isn't enough evidence to declare cause but it does suggest that there's merit to the idea that economic state affects movie success.

    <div class="slide-card inactive-slide">
        <h2>Variable Two: Keywords/Themes</h2>
        <label for="yearSlider" style="margin-left: 2em;">Year:</label>
        <div class="slider-wrapper">
            <input type="range"
                  id="yearSlider"
                  class="year-slider"
                  min="1911"
                  max="2024"
                  value="2024"
                  step="1">
            
            <div class="year-tooltip" id="yearTooltip">2024</div>
            
            <div class="year-labels">
                <span>1911</span>
                <span>2024</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <svg width="1000" height="500" id="keywords_graph"></svg>
        <p></p>
        <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: smaller;">
          The second factor we considered is keywords. Like genres, we chose to track the success of the top 10 revenue-generating keywords for every given year.
          
          <br><br>
          We chose to implement a dynamic bar chart with a timeline slider so that we could view changes in what the most popular keywords were for each year. The change in keywords is just as interesting, if not more interesting, than fluctuations of revenue.
          <br><br>

          We explored some notable recession years (1975, 1982, 1991, 2009, 2020) and found some interesting changes in keyword popularity in recession year vs neighboring years. Some years (1975, 1982, 2020) saw a rise in death or farewell related keywords.
          Other years (1991, 2009, 2020) saw increases in fictional and "fun" keywords. These changes are notable considering neighboring years did not include these keywords.
          
          <br><br>
          There's enough evidence for us to feel that there's a relationship between keyword popularity and economic state. So movie producers trying to create a successful movie should choose to release movies with specific themes strategically at times when the economy is good/bad. Exact relationships would require further data exploration and research.

    <div class="slide-card">
        <h2>Main Graph: Overall Relationship</h2>
        <svg width="1000" height="500" id="main_graph"></svg>
        
        <p></p>
        <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: smaller;">
          Our final visualization provides a summary view of the relationship between movie success, movie genre, and keywords. 

          <br><br>
          We implemented an advanced bar chart with overlayed line chart. Our bar chart has a further interaction of being able to click on any given bar to reveal an in-depth look into movie revenue month-by-month for a given year.
          The main interesting feature of this graph is the ability to filter revenue by genres and keywords to more closely examine the relationship between specific genre/keywords and movie success. To make this graph easier to explore recession effects, we've circled recession years on the GDP line graph.
          <br><br>

          For simplicity, we allow users to choose from the top 10 highest grossing genres and keywords to filter with. We've chosen to display total revenue for a given year rather than average revenue to reflect not only individual movie success but also demonstrate how much a certain genre/keyword is being release in any given year.
          For example, when selecting only the comedy genre there's an interesting trend of total revenue dipping for 3/5 recession years compared to immediate neighbors.
