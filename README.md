# Dataset Reduction
Our dataset originally had 23 columns and was 530 MB (556,689,157 bytes); this was far too large and could not be added to our github repo. We created a short python script (datasets/shrink.py") to extract the 5 columns we needed; this reduced the filesize to 71.8 MB (75,329,497 bytes).
